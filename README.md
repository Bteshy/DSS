This project analyzes the financial viability of two school expansion strategies:

Gradually building one class per year.
Building four classes in one year.
Methodology
I created Excel worksheets to model each scenario and analyze the financial outcomes. The worksheets include:

Variables Worksheet: Contains necessary variables for calculations.
Scenario Worksheets: Separate sheets for each expansion strategy.
Analysis Worksheet: Compares results from both scenarios.
Financial Analysis
For both scenarios, I calculated:

Total Fees: Based on student enrollment.
Expenses: Including teachers' wages, learning materials, building costs, loan interest, and defaulted fees.
Net Income: Total fees minus expenses.
Results
Four Classes at Once: Higher profit of 10,532,800 shillings.
Gradual Approach: Yields 8,070,400 shillings.
Recommendations
While rapid expansion offers higher immediate profits, it is crucial to consider the school's capacity to manage increased students and maintain quality. Gradual expansion, despite slightly lower profits, may be more sustainable.
